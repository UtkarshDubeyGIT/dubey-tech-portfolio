## Overview

An interactive web application that predicts laptop prices based on user-selected specifications using a machine learning model. Built with Streamlit, this project enables users to estimate laptop prices, explore data insights, and understand feature impacts on pricing through an intuitive interface.

The application serves as a practical tool for consumers looking to understand laptop pricing dynamics and make informed purchase decisions based on their desired specifications.

## Key Features

- **Price Prediction**: Enter laptop specifications (brand, RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, etc.) to get an instant price estimate powered by a trained machine learning model
- **Data Exploration**: Visualize price distributions, brand comparisons, and feature importance with interactive charts and statistical insights
- **Similar Laptops**: View real examples from the dataset that match your predicted price range, providing context and validation for estimates
- **Modern UI**: Enhanced with custom CSS for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience with intuitive navigation
- **Multi-Page Interface**: Organized into distinct sections for prediction, exploration, and project information

## Technical Architecture

### Dataset & Features

- **Dataset**: Over 1,300 laptops with various brands and specifications
- **Features**: Brand, Type (Notebook/Gaming/Ultrabook), RAM, Storage (HDD/SSD), CPU, GPU, Screen Size, Resolution, Operating System, Weight, Touchscreen capability, IPS display
- **Preprocessing**: Engineered features including storage type combinations, pixel density calculations, and categorical encoding

### Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Ensemble regression pipeline using scikit-learn
- **Techniques**: OneHotEncoder for categorical variables, RandomForest/GradientBoosting for prediction
- **Performance**: R² ≈ 0.86 (explains ~86% of price variance)
- **Pipeline**: Serialized model (`pipe.pkl`) and preprocessed DataFrame (`df.pkl`) for efficient predictions

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application framework for data science projects
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and pipeline creation
- **pandas & numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Statistical data visualization and plotting
- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language

## Model Development Process

1. **Data Collection**: Compiled dataset of 1,300+ laptops with comprehensive specifications
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created derived features like storage type combinations, pixel density, and brand encoding
3. **Model Training**: Experimented with multiple regression algorithms, optimizing for R² score and prediction accuracy
4. **Pipeline Creation**: Built scikit-learn pipeline with preprocessing steps and final model
5. **Validation**: Tested model performance on holdout data, achieving R² ≈ 0.86
6. **Deployment**: Packaged model and created Streamlit interface for user interaction

## Deployment

The application is deployment-ready with support for platforms like Render, Heroku, or similar:

- **Procfile** and **setup.sh** provided for automated deployment
- **Example Render build command**: `sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py`
- **Requirements**: All dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`
- **Environment**: Python 3.8+ with streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

## Key Insights

- **Brand Impact**: Premium brands (Apple, Razer, MSI) command significantly higher prices
- **RAM & Storage**: Linear relationship between memory capacity and price
- **GPU Influence**: Dedicated GPUs, especially high-end models, substantially increase laptop value
- **Display Quality**: High-resolution screens and IPS panels correlate with premium pricing
- **Model Accuracy**: The model successfully captures 86% of price variance, providing reliable estimates

## Use Cases

- **Consumer Research**: Help buyers understand fair pricing for desired specifications
- **Market Analysis**: Analyze pricing trends across brands and configurations
- **Educational Tool**: Demonstrate practical machine learning application in e-commerce
- **Specification Comparison**: Compare how different component choices affect pricing

## Future Enhancements
